### Instructions
**You will need to have nodejs installed, feel free to ask for help**
1. Clone the repo, and `cd` into it
2. Run `npm i`
3. You are encouraged to install **nodemon** using npm -> `npm i -g nodemon`
    which will live-reload your application as you make changes
  * If you do 3. you can then just type `npm start` to run the server, your changes will be reloaded automatically
  * Otherwise, type `node server.js` (you'll have to manually stop and restart the server to show changes)

   This project uses Bootstrap 4 and jQuery 3, cdn links are already included
    in index.html
   You can add additional routes in `lib/routes.js` if you are so inclined
