### Instructions
* **You will need to have nodejs installed, don't hesitate to ask for help** *
1. Clone the repo, and `cd` into it
2. Run `npm i` - this will install Express so you can run the app locally
3. You are encouraged to install **nodemon** using npm :arrow_right: `npm i -g nodemon`
    which will live-reload your application as you make changes
  * If you do 3. you can then just type `npm start` to run the server, your changes will be reloaded automatically (you do have to manually refresh your browser though.)
  * Otherwise, type `node server.js` (you'll have to manually stop and restart the server to show changes)
4. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser (make sure you aren't already using that port for something else)
   This project uses Bootstrap 4 and jQuery 3, cdn links are already included
    in index.html
   You can add additional routes in `lib/routes.js` if you are so inclined
